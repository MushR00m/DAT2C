DAT2C
=====

The project is a Telecommunications Substation of Distribution Automation, Including IEC60870-101, IEC60870-104. Power Communication via TCP/UDP, Serial Port and other channel. Including some application about power automation. 

The project used some of the feature of boost and openssl. Need to add the include and lib path for both to compile.

The DAT2C need a sub.xml as main config file to run, there is a sample called sub-demo.xml in the cfg menu.
